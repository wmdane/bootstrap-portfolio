# bootstrap-portfolio

For this project I used what we've learned about basic html, bootstrap, and css to construct a mock-up portfolio page.
Almost every element on the page was imported from bootstraps website with the exception of the footer, which from what I've read do not have any examples to lift off of the basic bootstrap page. I did find examples of various footers that make use of bootstrap's style sheet, but most of those required adding additional style sheets which I avoided because I wasn't sure how they would interact with the sheet I was already using. So for the footer, I just ended up making my own by adding css into the <head> tag.
Bootstrap being responsive out of the box was a huge help and made it much easier to configure everything on the page, but I did run into an issue on the about me page where at a screen size of around 350px-400px, the text didn't fully drop down below the profile picture. My own screen limited how small I could shrink the page and so I couldn't actually replicate this while working on it and could only view it on my friend's iPhone X.
One other issue I ran into was with the footer. By using absolute positioning and the bottom modifier, I could make the footer hug the bottom of the screen on pages that required scrolling, but on the about me page, the footer just hugged the bottom of the content which only reached about mid page on my screen.
